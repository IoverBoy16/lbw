       Dandelion

        <pre>
        A fine ray glistening amongst the lush meadow,
        Oh! To watch it dance, so very soft and yellow.
        Ordinary for most- simply beauty to me.
        Bring life to my jewel, homage, dear Bumble Bee.

        My flower brings creation, a soft melody, 
        Typical for fools. To me? A fab remedy.
        She sings, dances and smiles, a sail in the breeze,
        Fate abruptly took her, ignorant of my pleas.

        Eyes sealed, the stunning dandelion remains here,
        Why awaken to truth? For it is loss I fear.
        To walk the unknown, scary, what comes into view?

        Scattering her seeds like ashes, The Child roams free,
        Possessing none and all. Enemy of my glee.
        Exists there treasures of hope? No, I must be through.

        A painting in my mind, a flower in the glade.
        Golden pearls which shined, color which could not fade.
        A soft stream in motion, ripe willow leaves for hair.
        Timeless as the ocean, a butterfly so rare.

       City Circus

    <h3>
        <pre>
        Neon lights flashing, a cyclist always dashing,
        Car horns beeping, pigeons leaping, nature sleeping.
        Yellow reflecting lines, mixing confusing signs,
        The heartbeat of the street, lively and so neat.

        Searching for a longing gaze in this concrete maze,
        Never will it be found, this home of safe and sound.
        None will escape, destiny battles the red cap.
        We will die there, never together forever.

       Daisy and Gatsby

    </h2>
    <h3>
        <pre>
        Donâ€™t lie, I am not yours, you are not mine.				
        And yet when I sea you,						
        I wish for our hearts to intertwine.					
        Stop signs, green traffic lights, I desire to see it through.		
        Young love perished in war. Young love slain at core.		
        
        Gallop gleefully in the glowing horizon,				
        As this frigid field freezes itself frozen.				
        The dandelions dance until the final dates,				
        See as her pupils sparkle at the pearly gates.				
        But here I am, through you, feeling all sensations,			
        You make my dreams, my hopes and my aspirations.            
        </pre>
