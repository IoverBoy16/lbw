    <h1>Music, Songs & Melodies</h1>

    <h3>
        <pre>
        Hi... I hope you're doing well 😊
        
        I'm not quite sure how to create a marvelous introduction~ but I hope you enjoy this page
        Listening to music since you came into my life has been a joyride of emotions to say the least
        Every lyric has so much meaning, without even saying your name, it's all it reminds me of, in the sweetest way possible
        So- I'm dedicating a whole page to music playlists:
        my favourite songs to you, my favourite songs you showed me and maybe more!

        I guess I'll start with the songs you showed me I loved, which... might've ended up in my most listened songs of the year :D

        Febuary, 27th you added the song "Stumblin' in 🎵"
        Writing this, I realize I hadn't listened to it in a long time
        It's flooding all the great memories I'd forgotten to be honest, yapping to you late at night, seeing you at school
        talking to you in math class. It's a beautiful song, and I'm grateful for you having shown it to

        Later that day, "Wild World 🎵" was also added to the playlist
        When I tell you I really loved this song, I can't really express it, but it was my 5th most listened to song (🫢)
        So it might just explain itself. It's short, sweet and simple

        You introduced me to Laufey & beabadoobee, and though I can confess I'm not sure I would have liked these singers on their own
        whatching how excited you were to listen to them, hearing you sing I sort of just also sank my heart into their songs and never came to regret it

        My personal favourite songs from beadadoobee were certainly:
            1) How was your day 🎵
            2) You're here that's the thing 🎵
            3) A night to remember 🎵 (Laufey & beadadoobee)
        
        The lyrics definitely speak to me a whole lot more in the first one, but hearing you sing "but you're hereee that's the thing"
        is one of my fondest and cutest memories of you I oddly don't think I will forget
        A playlist, my favourite beabadoobee songs: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7hVVmbAKLs8IuVzwdvLnf0?si=fc2c0714952d4451">beabadoobee spotify playlist</a>

        For Laufey, I suppose I just liked whatever you showed me which might be a tad bias hehe, so these were my 3 favourite songs from her!
            - Lovesick 🎵
            - Dreamer 🎵
            - From The Start 🎵

        Not very original I confess, perhaps you are just a great big influence on me 🤷

        "Days Go By 🎵" & "Do Friends Fall in Love? 🎵" definitely feel quite similar to "Stumblin' in 🎵", 
        they fly me back in time, and it's definitely soothing and reminds me of all the joyful moments we shared 🫶

        La La Land, the movie you liked ever so much... I confess I watched it, or tried to at least
        The plot was certainly good, but I couldn't keep up with all the singing and dancing, called it quits halfway through unfortunately
        But when the scene came on with the song "A Lovely Night 🎵", I thought it was going to be as beautiful or more than when you showed me
        It was fortunately not even close to being up to par. When we sang that song, alternating the voice lines from the guy to the girl, those
        moments were so magical to me. Watching you bob your head to the orchestra music after the lyrics finished was equally wonderful. I 
        really realized in that moment, it was never about the music originally, it was about how special and great you made them 🥰

        Your odd taste for Jazz and Frank Sinatra truly perplexed me, it never matched your personality and yet, there I was
        learning every lyric to "Somethin' Stupid 🎵". Certainly my favourite song from him you showed me... and then I go
        and spoil it all by saying something stupid like I loove you 💘

        "As the World Caves In 🎵" was an equally beautiful song, I loved it, love it and will continue to do so.

        It's a little bit funny, this feeling insiide ♪
        "Your Song 🎵" by Elton John certainly wound up being one of my favourite songs from him. I was shocked
        I had never heard it before, and of course, every lyric was learned to this one too :p

        I've beeen dreaming of youuu ♪
        and how I hold you tiightly. ♪
        Allll of the thiings I doo ♪
        if I only have a chaaance ♪

        I've been dreaaming of you... ♪
        You've been dreaming of me... ♪

        To this day, "Dreaming of You 🎵" by Yu Sakai is one of my favourite songs of all time. His voice, the lyrics, the instruments
        all come together so perfectly, and I especially adore the sort of quire singing in the background. I'll have to give this song the top 3
        spot certainly for songs you've shown me, so for that, thank you 💗

        "There is a light that never goes out" & "Die with a smile" were awfully romantic of you too, I remember seeing the OC transpo double
        decker when you first sang it and I had nooo clue what you were yapping about but I definitely came to love the song. I guess even
        if both songs sound different, they had that same message & feeling to me, which were both, very very special 😊

        I can still remember the joy, excitement and jubilation (aren't I elevated) when I had seen the new songs you added to playlists, that 
        pure joy and bliss almost childish in nature was one of the most special feelings in the world, because it came from you ❤️

        So...

        ♪ Iiiif the world was ending I'd wanna be next to youuuuuu 💓

        Just the way you are ♪
        And when you smile ♪
        The whole world stops and stares for a while ♪
        'Cause, girl, you're amazing ♪
        Just the way you are ♪
